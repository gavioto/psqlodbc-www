This is the content of the psqlodbc website, currently published at
https://odbc.postgresql.org/.

The site consists of static pages, kept in this git repository
(git://git.postgresql.org/git/psqlodbc-www.git). The files in the media
subdirectory are copied from the main PostgreSQL website, at
www.postgreqsql.org. The pages themselves also contain headers and footers
copied directly from www.postgresql.org, to achieve the same look and feel.

In addition to the files stored in this repository, the latest documentation
from the "docs" subdirectory in the main psqlodbc source repository should
be copied here, under docs.
